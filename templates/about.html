    About Me
  </h2>

  <p>
    I advocate a straightforward approach as a college guidance counselor: the
    focus must be finding the best particular path for each student. In some
    cases, this means pursuing admission at the country’s most elite private
    universities. Sometimes this means searching for just the right quirky
    liberal arts college. Sometimes this means starting off in community
    college. And sometimes this means taking one or two gap years in exploration
    of other possibilities.

    Every child is different. My commitment is to find and understand these
    differences.

    A selection of the services I offer:
    <li>Optimizing high school course selection.</li>
    <li>Walking through the college application process, from big picture—which
      schools are good fits and realistic targets—to the fine details—how to
      approach the college essay.
    </li>
    <li>Uncovering assistance available through the Free Application for Federal
      Student Aid (FAFSA).
    </li>
    <li>Honing extracurricular activities to help your competitiveness.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Prior to this work as an independent guidance counselor, I spent 15 years in
    Portland Public Schools, where I experienced a wide range of environments. I
    worked with at-risk youth populations, and, for the bulk of my career, I
    worked in the competitive halls of Lincoln High School.

    I’m the mother of two grown sons, and so consider myself personally close to
    this moment of transition. Please get in touch if you’d like to learn more
    about how I might help.
